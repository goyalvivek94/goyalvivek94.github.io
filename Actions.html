              <h3>Be a part of the change with WeForest</h3>
              <p>
                According to estimates from the World Bank, between 1990 and 2016, the world lost around 1.3 million square kilometres of forest - an area larger than South Africa. And unfortunately, reforestation isn't just as simple as planting trees in the ground and leaving them to grow. Trees also need to be taken care of - in the long term - to ensure that they flourish and reach their full potential. The organisation WeForest has dedicated itself to the successful, and sustainable, community-based restoration of forests. WeForest is particularly active in tropical regions, where forests act as the most powerful carbon sinks and are particularly effective in mitigating global warming. Their focus is not only on planting new trees, but above all on ensuring their long-term growth and prosperity - in cooperation with local communities. The international non-profit organisation identifies the causes of deforestation and develops sustainable, economic alternatives together with the local population.

              <h3>Volunteer with ISHA foundation Cauvery Calling</h3>
              <p>
                "Cauvery has been the source of wellbeing, prosperity and the very source of life for these lands. A forest-fed perennial river is fast becoming a seasonal stream as 87% of tree cover has been removed in 50 years. Cauvery is calling, do you have a heart to hear?" – Sadhguru
              </p>
              <p>
                Cauvery Calling is a first of its kind campaign, setting the standard for how India’s rivers – the country’s lifelines – can be revitalized. It will initiate the revitalization of Cauvery river and transform the lives of 84 million people
